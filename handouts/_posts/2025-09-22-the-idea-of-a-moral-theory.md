Traditionally, a complete moral theory is understood to include both a theory of right and a theory of value.

## Theory of Right

A *theory of right (conduct)* investigates the **grounds of the deontic status of actions**: X is the morally right/wrong thing to do because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

### Deontic status of actions

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<center>
<table class="tg mb-5"><thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky" rowspan="2">Morally right actions</th>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Obligatory</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Permissible</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Morally wrong actions</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Impermissible</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>
### Grounds of deontic status

(1) *Metaphysical explanation*: What *makes* an action right/wrong? Or, *by virtue of* what is an action right/wrong?

- Not an issue of correlation or even necessary/sufficient conditions: A theory of right should give more than a mere thumbs-up/-down and offer a compelling story of the “why?”
- Consider: X is the morally right/wrong thing to do if and only if Ding’s crystal ball says so—not *explanatory* even if true!
- Consider also: X is the morally right/wrong thing to do if and only if God so commands.
  - The Euthyphro problem: Is X is the morally right/wrong thing to do *because* God so commands, or does God command that we do/not do X *because* X is the morally right/wrong thing to do?
  - Horn 1: God commands that we do/not do X because X is the morally right/wrong thing to do—not explanatory, implying independent moral standards.
  - Horn 2: X is the morally right/wrong thing to do because God so commands (divine command theory)—arbitrary, undermining the authority of morality.

(2) *Action guidance*: How do we figure out in practice if an action is morally right/wrong?
- “Ding’s crystal ball” theory is not very usable: I have only one crystal ball to consult, and it’s often hard to tell what the crystal ball is saying.

## Theory of Value (“Axiology”)

Theory of value ≠ value theory (catch-all for ethics, political philosophy, etc.).

- A *theory of good (affairs)* investigates what makes **states of affairs** morally good/bad.
- A *theory of moral worth* investigates what makes **agents** morally good/not, virtuous/not.
