**Axiological theories of right**: The deontic status of an action is fully and directly grounded in its value.

- Analogy: H & O atoms make up H<sub>2</sub>O molecules which in turn make up the water in my bottle.
  - Direct grounds: To say that the water in my bottle are made of H<sub>2</sub>O is not deny that it is further made of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
  - Full grounds: No other molecules make up the water in my bottle.

- *Consequentialism*: The deontic status of an action is grounded fully and directly in the value of its consequences.

**Deontological theories of right**: The deontic status of an action is not fully and directly grounded in its value.

- Possibilities:
  - Denying full grounds: Either considerations of value do not matter at all or other considerations also matter morally. 
  - Denying direct grounds: Either considerations of value do not matter at all or they matter only indirectly.
- The defining deontological objection: At least sometimes, two axiologically identical actions may differ in deontic status.

## The “sacrifice one to save five” pairs of cases

An adequate moral theory should either explain or explain away this pattern.

- The deontological objection: Axiological theories in general and consequentialist theories in particular cannot.
  - *In-class activity*: What can a consequentialist say for themself?
- Motivation for a *deontological constraint*: What matters morally is not just how good the consequences are, but the ways in which these consequences are brought about.

## Two competing explanations

- The Doctrine of the Double Effect: It is at least sometimes [when?] morally permissible to bring about bad consequences if they are *merely foreseen* rather than *intended*.
	- “Sometimes”: Deaths due to snake oil may be merely foreseen but are nevertheless wrongful; the bad consequences must be justified.
  - Intended consequences are aimed at either as the agent’s end or as a means to the agent’s end (either way: they are part of the plan); merely foreseen consequences are not so intended.
  - Example: Going to class on a rainy day.
    - Intended/part of the plan:
      - End: Arriving at the classroom.
      - Means to the end: Getting on the 1 train, climbing stairs, etc.
    - Merely foreseen/not part of the plan:
      - Getting my clothes wet, scanning ID to enter campus (!), etc.
  - Pair I: The death of the one patient is intended in the serum case but not in the drug case.
  - Pari II: The death of the innocent person is intended in the blackmail case but not in the trolley (driver) case.
- A distinction between *doing* and *allowing* harm: “To refrain from inflicting injury ourselves is a stricter duty than to prevent other people from inflicting injury, which is not to say that the other is not a very strict duty indeed” (p. 13).
  - Allowing harm is failing to prevent harm (“letting die”); doing harm is causing harm (“killing”).
  - Not the intending/merely foreseeing distinction; also not the act/omission distinction.

Note that the trolley (driver) case is special: The choice is between killing one vs. five.

## Foot’s counterexample to double effect

The lethal fumes case (p. 13): Manufacture lifesaving gas to save five, releasing lethal gas killing one.

- Foot takes it that this a case where the doctrine of the double effect applies: It is after all structurally identical to the trolley (driver) case.
- The doctrine of the double effect must explain why releasing lethal fumes is wrong but diverting the trolley as the driver is not.
  - Foot suggests that it can’t: The death of the one is not part of the plan/not a means to saving the five it is a merely foreseen consequence.
  - She argues that we need the distinction between doing and allowing harm for this: Even though you merely foresee that the one patient will die, you bring about their death.
