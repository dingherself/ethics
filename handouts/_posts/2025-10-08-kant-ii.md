## Translating Kant into contemporary normative ethical terms

Grounding deontic status in rational agency: X is the morally right/wrong thing to do because it satisfies/fails the principle of practical reason (i.e., the *categorical imperative*).

1. *Formula of universal law*: Kant has in mind practical reason that’s *a priori* and holds with absolute necessity, which implies the universality of its requirements; “I ought never to act except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law” (*G* 4:402).
2. *The humanity formulation*: Rational nature is not merely instrumentally valuable but “exists as an end in itself,” which implies that rational agents, insofar as we are rational, also exist as ends in ourselves; “act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means” (4:429).
3. *The autonomy formulation*: Our rational nature is such that we do not merely obey but legislate the categorical imperative; act that you regard “the will of every rational being as a will giving universal law” (4:431).
4. *The kingdom of ends formulation*: We end up with a picture where we are not only ends in ourselves individually, but “in systematic connection” forming “a kingdom of ends”  (4:433); “every rational being must act as if he were by his maxims at all times a lawgiving member of the universal kingdom of ends” (4:438).

Are all of these formulations as equivalent as Kant thinks they are?

## Getting our hands dirty

Apply both the universal law formulation and the humanity formulation to Kant’s four examples (G 4:421–23).

- Suicide
- False promise
- Self-cultivation
- Helping others
