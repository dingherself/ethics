## Possible Essay Prompts

*Two of the following prompts will be selected to appear on the exam, and you will be asked to answer <u><strong>one</strong></u> of the two. An excellent essay will build on but go beyond our class discussions in some significant way. Aim for 500–700 words.*

1. To what extent are disagreements among first-order normative ethical theories disagreements on philosophical methodology?
1. Most say that ethics is about what we ought to do and what sort of person we ought to be. If philosophy is an activity and the ethicist a sort of person, how well does ethics as a field itself withstand ethical scrutiny?
1. [The American Revolution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)—was it morally justified?
