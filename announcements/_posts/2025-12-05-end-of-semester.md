title: "Peer Feedback, Course Evaluations, and My Office Hours Next Week"
---

Dear class,

I just set up peer review on CourseWorks. If you have not used CW for this before, here is a quick [tutorial](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-a-peer-review-to-an-assignment/ta-p/293). I have more instructions on how to write feedback [here](https://ethics.dingherself.com/handouts/term-paper.html#peer-feedback-graded). Please return your comments by midnight on Friday, December 12 so that your classmates will have time to think through them, and do reach out to us if there is an issue of any sort!

I want to encourage you again to complete course evaluations, which will close by midnight on Thursday, December 11. We want to hear your feedback! If you have enjoyed the class, tell us about it and use this as an opportunity to reflect on your experience; if you have suggestions about which aspects of the course are and are not working, they will inform and shape the way we teach in the future. The results are fully anonymous and won’t be released to us until after we post your final course grades.

One last thing, the finals are scrambling my schedule:

- I’ll still have my regular office hours this upcoming Monday, December 8.
- On Wednesday the 10th, I have a conflict but can meet by appointment after 1:45-ish.
- I may have time to meet on Thursday the 11th, though I’m not sure yet -- just email me!

I hope the end of the semester is being kind to all of you! Happy writing, and please don’t forget to find some time to recharge and take care of yourself.

All my best,

Ding
