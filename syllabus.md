## Course Description

This course surveys both traditional and alternative approaches to normative ethics. We will focus on a contrast between more armchair-style analytic ethics and more socially engaged ways of doing ethics, and we will pay special attention to the complex interplay between theories and cases. Topics will include consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, care ethics, non-ideal ethics, reproductive ethics, the intersection of ethics with epistemology, and existentialist ethics.

One prior course in philosophy, as well as concurrent enrollment in Phil 3711, is required.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

In {{ site.course_number }}, students will learn to

1. Analyze philosophical questions from metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political theory;
2. Employ humanistic methods and tools to develop, articulate, and argue for their own views on these philosophical questions;
3. Charitably interpret and critically assess philosophical texts and arguments; and
4. Discuss the nature and value of philosophical reflection in light of our contemporary world.

## Required Texts

I will make all required readings available digitally. If there are any barriers (technical, etc.) that make it difficult for you to access them, please don’t be afraid to let me know.

### Barnard statement on affordable access to course texts and materials

All students deserve to be able to study and make use of course texts and materials regardless of cost. Barnard librarians have partnered with students, faculty, and staff to find ways to increase student access to textbooks. By the first day of advance registration for each term, faculty will have provided information about required texts for each course on CourseWorks (including ISBN or author, title, publisher, copyright date, and price), which can be viewed by students. A number of cost-free or low-cost methods for accessing some types of courses texts are detailed on the [Barnard Library](https://library.barnard.edu/textbook-affordability) [Textbook Affordability](https://library.barnard.edu/textbook-affordability) guide. Undergraduate students who identify as first-generation and/or low-income students may check out items from the [FLI lending libraries in the](https://library.barnard.edu/find-borrow/FLIpartnership) [Barnard Library](https://library.barnard.edu/find-borrow/FLIpartnership) and in [Butler Library](https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/undergraduate/FLI_partnership_library.html) for an entire semester. Students may also consult with their professors, the Dean of Studies, and the Financial Aid Office about additional affordable alternatives for having access to course texts. Visit the guide and talk to your professors and your librarian for more details.

## Assessment

Final course grades will be awarded on the following basis:

- [Participation (incl. in-class activities)](#participation): 20%
- [Course lexicon](#course-lexicon): 10%
- [Midterm & final exams](#exams): 45%
- [Scaffolded term paper](#scaffolded-term-paper): 25%

All course requirements must be completed in order to pass this class. **An F received on any work due to academic misconduct is grounds for an F in the course.**

### Participation

In approaching a philosophical issue, we will often find ourselves in the middle of a long conversation among many different authors. A hallmark of what we do in philosophy is the way we participate in this conversation and position ourselves in relation to these authors: we are not outside observers just here to absorb what each author has said and perhaps to summarize some of the points of agreement and disagreement; rather, we are equal parties to the conversation, just like every other philosopher. It’s helpful, then, to think of philosophy classes not as where you come to be lectured about particular philosophical views, but as where we gather to *do philosophy together*, to contribute our own insights to ongoing philosophical conversations, and to think through these difficult issues *for ourselves*.

Participation in philosophy courses also serves a wide range of pedagogical purposes: class discussions help students make sense of difficult ideas and arguments in the texts; they help students learn to explain and apply concepts, analyze and assess arguments, and formulate and respond to worries and objections; in addition, they contribute to other students’ learning experience by helping to build a vibrant, mutually supportive classroom environment that encourages questions, exchange of ideas, and philosophical reflection.

You are expected to regularly contribute to class discussions and participate in class activities. To do that, you are expected to have read the assigned texts carefully and critically *in advance of class* (remember to bring a copy with you as we will often look at difficult passages together!).

It’s useful to keep in mind that philosophical writing is, at bottom, argumentative—that is, its goal is to defend or criticize a particular view. As you do the readings, be sure to:

- Keep track of what the author says they mean by a particular term or distinction, and take note of terms and distinctions that don’t quite make sense to you.
- Identify the view the author is defending and the argument they are offering in support of their view (be careful to distinguish passages where the author is speaking for themself and where they are explaining another author’s view or considering objections!), and write down thoughts and questions in the margin as you react to each step in the argument.
- Ask yourself if you think what the author is saying is not only plausible but well-argued. If not, think about why not: Is it because the author’s argument relies on a false premise, or is it because the author’s reasoning is fallacious? Is there a more plausible or more arguable way of formulating the point the author hopes to make? Are there countervailing considerations, alternative positions, or further complications that the author fails to take into account? Even if you agree with the author, try to anticipate objections that other readers may reasonably raise and think about how you can respond to them on the author’s behalf.

For this class, in-class activities during lectures (which will be graded for completion) will make up 10% of your final grade, and participation in your discussion section another 10%.

### Course lexicon

Throughout this semester, please keep a running lexicon of the technical terms that we encounter in both our readings and our class discussions. Feel free to just jot these down in your notes as you go, though the versions you turn in should be typed and cleaned up, and they should include not only a list of terms but their definitions/explanations (verbal or visual)—think dictionary entries.

I will ask everybody to turn in a midterm version of their lexicon, which you may consult during the midterm exam. This is merely a progress check and will not be graded; however, failure to turn one in on time will be penalized by up to a full letter grade (10%) on the final version.

The final version of your lexicon should be comprehensive and will make up 10% of your final grade.

### Exams

There will be a midterm and a final exam. Study guides, including possible essay prompts, will be distributed in advance. The final exam is not comprehensive, and will be of the same format as the midterm.

The better of your two exams will account for 25% of your final grade, and the other one 20%.

### Scaffolded term paper

You are required to draft and revise a term paper for this course; you will also be asked to provide peer feedback on two of your classmates’ drafts and to complete scaffolded writing exercises along the way. I will circulate instructions and prompts ahead of time.

The term paper assignment as a whole will make up 25% of your final grade.
